# WGSN canvas, draggable images and performance

When click any of right-side images, it will add the image to the Canvas part of the left.
When the image is added to the Canvas then itâ€™s automatically created as a new layer. 
Each layer can be manipulated in the following ways:

1. mousedown
1. mouseup
1. mousemove
1. scale/resize
1. rotate

## Quick start:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/williamjxj/WGSN.git
$ cd WGSN
$ bower install
```

To access the page:

1. in `Webstorm`, click `index.html` to directly access the webpage.
1. using a [http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), then open it with the web server supports
1. or from: http://dixitruth.com:9090/wsgn

## Advantages:

1. Dragable, movable in Canvas.
1. Resizable
1. Rotating
1. no CPU issue, the CPU remains stable and reasonable.
1. no Memory leak, the memory remains stable
1. Multi-images co-exist in Canvas, the screen is clean, separated by layers.
1. both `drag` and `click` right-side images work
1. use `jQuery` and `Twitter Bootstrap` latest version
1. use `bower` to manage these vender components


## Optional:

when clearRect, the following implements will only erase the activate one, not others:

```html
<div style="position: relative;">
 <canvas id="layer1" width="100" height="100"
   style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 0;"></canvas>
 <canvas id="layer2" width="100" height="100"
   style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 1;"></canvas>
</div>
```
